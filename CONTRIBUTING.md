# Contributing

Please have a look at the issue board about what's currently going on. If you see an issue that is not assigned yet and
that you can and want to work on, please leave a comment to reach out to one of our developers. You can also ask
questions and discuss the issue.

# Bug reports

Please check if the bug was already reported by searching the existing issues. If it does, feel free to leave a comment
that you also have this issue. Add additional information, screenshots, log files etc. The more information and details
we have, the easier it might get to solve the issue.

When creating new issues, use our template for reporting bugs. It tells you what kind of information we need.

# Pull requests: bugfixes, new features or other code contributions

Pull requests are welcome! May it be a PR to an already known issue or a new feature that you consider as a valuable
contribution, please open a PR. If you want to start working on a new feature that was proposed in an issue, yet, it
is recommended to reach out to the developers about this, first, to discuss if this contribution is valuable to the
project. Otherwise, you might waste your time on implementing something that won't make it into master.

Please read our [development guidelines](doc/development/development.md) as they contain valuable information that your
contribution meets our standards.

Fork the upstream repository and start developing on your personal fork. Make sure to test your changes with games that
are affected by them. Pay attention to the target platform/hardware you are testing on! This is valuable information
that should be included in the PR.

Once you completed your implementation, open a pull request on the upstream repository to propose your changes. We will
review your contribution and get back to you about any changes or when we merge them to our upstream repository. Your
changes, once approved, will be included in the next release.

# Roadmap 

No concrete roadmap or timeline exists. When the time is right, we continue adding support for newer games as well.
